This project is generated by CubeMX and then programmed using the Keil compiler. It is simulated using Proteus. 
The project utilizes Timer 1, with two channels active on the timer. One channel generates a PWM signal while the other generates its inverse.
To display the CCR changes, a character LCD is used. Finally, the motors are driven using the L293D driver.
